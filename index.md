### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 07, part 2, was one of my favorites because I discovered how related
    coding and street signs are. I was able to figure out how AND/OR statements
    work. It was interesting to see how specific certain signs can become and
    the different ways I would have to code.

* Lab 5

    Lab 05, part 2, was another favorite of mine due to the introduction of
    integers, decimals, and conversion. Being able to convert integers so that
    they can be properly utilized was a fun challenge. Albeit I was confused
    but after further guidance and explanation it became entertaining to complete.

* Lab 6

    Lab 06, part 2, was my favorite lab of the semester. Blackjack is more complex
    than any of the other scenarios we were dealt and I immediately realized how 
    the gameâ€™s aspects can be applied to code. Since its a game, I made use of 
    not-statements and functions to determine which side wins.
